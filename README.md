- Gets your current playing Lecture or Video by itself (No need to manually config).
- Shows the time left for that lecture.
- ~~Helps you covering your all the backlogs in a day.~~ XD

## Installation

This project requires [Python](https://python.org) to be installed, and is only functional on **Unix operating systems** due to the nature of MPRIS.

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-ag/discord-rpc.git
cd discord-rpc
```

2. Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Just `cd` into the `dicord-rpc` folder and run the following:

```bash
./start
```

The client will connect to your account.
